// Get the jelly

// Get the peanut butter

// Get the bread

// Spread peanut butter on one side and jelly on the other

// Combine the two sides

//Here's an example of an algorithm. What steps could we add before, after, or in between steps?

/* Breaking it down: Where is the jelly? Get the jelly from x, and bring it to the
table and place it on the table near your chair. Open The Jelly. Where is the peanut 
butter? Get the peanut butter from x and bring it to the table and place it near the 
chair on the table. Open the peanut butter. Where is the bread? Get the bread from x and 
bring it to the table and place it on the table next to the jelly. Where are the plates? 
Get a plate from x and bring it to the table and lay it in front of your chair on the table. 
Open the bread. Remove two slices from the top of the bag and place them flat and next to 
each other on the plate. Where is the knife? Get the knife from x and bring it to the 
table and hold it in one hand. Use the knife to scoop some jelly from the jelly jar, then
spread that jelly on one slice of bread on the side of the slice facing away from the
plate. Make sure the entire face of that slice of bread has jelly on it. Use the knife
to scoop some peanut butter out of the peanut butter jar and spread it on the other slice 
of bread on the plate on the side of the slice facing away from the plate. Lift the slice
of bread with jelly on it with your left hand without touching the jelly. Lift the slice
of bread with peanut butter on it with your right hand without touching the peanut
butter. Place the side of the slice of bread in your left hand on top of the slice of bread 
in your right such that the part of the slice with jelly is flat against the part of the
other slice with peanut butter such that all the edges of the two slices coincide with 
each other. Now the peanut butter and jelly sandwich is complete. */

//How do I make an image slide off the screen after 3 seconds?

// Delay the script by 3 seconds

// Select the image with a jQuery selector,

// Move the image across the screen somehow (positioning? margins?),
// by adding a certain amount of space every x milliseconds

//How can we break up the above algorithm even further?

/* Open a page with an image. Decide which direction the picture is going to slide off of
the screen. Decide how long it will take for image to be completely off the screen. Devise 
code that will accomplish the movement of the image in that direction in the chosen
amount of time. */
